# üî¶ IR Interruption Detector PCB

This project is a complete PCB-based system that detects interruptions between an **IR emitter and receiver**. When an object blocks the IR beam:
- A **buzzer/speaker** is triggered,
- A **7-segment display counter** is incremented,
- A **reset button** clears the count.

The circuit is entirely based on **discrete components**, including **NE555 timers**, **CD40106**, and a **CD4033** counter/decoder. It also includes a **robust regulated power supply**, and can be used in security, object-counting, or automation systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Overview

### ‚û§ Power Supply
The power input is **230V AC**, stepped down using a transformer and rectified via a **bridge diode**. The output is regulated to **+12V DC** using a **7812 voltage regulator**.

---

### ‚û§ IR Transmitter Stage

- **Components**: 2x NE555 + TSAL4400 IR LED
- The first NE555 generates a **square wave** (~38 kHz), modulated by the second NE555 to create an **amplitude-modulated IR beam**.
- Transistor **Q1** amplifies the signal and drives the IR LED with enough current.

---

### ‚û§ IR Receiver & Detection

- **TSOP2254** is used to receive the modulated IR beam.
- Its digital output goes **LOW** when it detects the 38 kHz signal.
- When an interruption occurs (e.g. hand/object blocks the beam), the output goes **HIGH**, triggering further stages.

---

### ‚û§ Signal Conditioning & Alarm Logic

- NE555 (U6) is configured in a monostable mode.
- CD40106 Schmitt triggers (U2, U3) are used for **clean signal shaping** and logic handling.
- This ensures only valid interruptions trigger the output.

---

### ‚û§ Output Stage

- A speaker or buzzer (AST-1732MR-R) is triggered via transistor Q3.
- An LED also indicates the alarm visually.

---

### ‚û§ Counting Stage

- A **CD4033B** 7-segment BCD counter increments with each IR interruption.
- A **D168K** display shows the count.
- A reset button allows clearing the count manually.

## üîÅ Workflow Summary

1. **Idle**: IR signal is received, no object interrupting.
2. **Interrupt**: Object breaks the beam ‚Üí TSOP output goes HIGH.
3. **Detection**: NE555 monostable timer triggers.
4. **Alarm**: Buzzer sounds + 7segments Display increments count.
5. **Reset**: Pressing the reset button clears the counter.
